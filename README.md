# AB-Testing-Medical-Website-Enhancements-with-Regression-Analysis
A/B tests are very commonly performed by data analysts and data scientists. For this project, I will be working to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. My goal is to work through this notebook to help the company understand if they should:

<br> - Implement the new webpage
<br> - Keep the old webpage
<br> - Perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.

# Dependancies  
  <br> - statsmodels.api
  <br> - Pandas 
  <br> - Numpy
  <br> - Random
  <br> - Matplotlib

## The Project Has 3 parts : 
<br> Part I - Probability
<br> Part II - A/B Test
<br> Part III - A regression approach
